Welcome to the Fibonacci Machine!

Enter the command 'java fibonaccinum z' or the command 'java -jar fibonaccinum z' (without the quotation marks)
with 'z' replaced with an integer between 0 and 19 (inclusive).

Once you do this, the Fibonacci number for the number you entered with your command will be shown in the terminal.
For example, if you enter the command 'java fibonaccinum 7' or 'java -jar fibonaccinum 7', '13' will appear in the terminal.

What is the Fibonacci sequence? It is a sequence that takes the previous 2 numbers' outputs and adds them together to get the next
input's output. For example, if we know the 7th term in the sequence is 8 and the 6th is 5, the 8th term is 6+5, which is 13.
Note that while this is the 8th term, entering 7 into the program gives you 13. This is because the Fibonacci sequence starts
with its input at 0, not 1.

Note that by inputs, we mean x-values and by outputs we mean y-values. You cannot change the Fibonacci sequence in this
program.

Note that this program only gives the first 20 Fibonacci numbers, so entering anything larger than 19 will result in an
invalid input statement, telling you to enter a valid input. The same goes for numbers less than 0.
